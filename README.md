Tinkering with a JS plugin system

This is just some dorky attempt to grab some bundle of js/html/css and inject it into a page so that it uses stuff

in this case I wrote a rot13 plugin (that breaks on `m`) and a reverse plugin

I chucked it up online at http://zip-tinkering-plugins.herokuapp.com/
